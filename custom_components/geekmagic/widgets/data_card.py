"""Declarative widget-layout primitive: ``DataCard``.

Most "complication"-style widgets (status, entity, text, progress,
climate, gauges, clock, ...) display the same conceptual three-band
shape:

  caption   ← caps-tracked tertiary label, top
  hero      ← primary big number/text, middle (auto-fit)
  support   ← optional row of small label/value chips
  indicator ← optional Bar / VerticalBar / Sparkline / Ring / Arc

Before this primitive existed, every widget hand-rolled its own
``int(width * 0.05)`` padding, ``current_y +=`` cursor, and
``is_narrow / is_compact / is_expanded`` cell-shape branching. Same
shape, seven slightly different implementations.

``DataCard`` lets a widget *list its data* in a single dataclass and
delegates layout to one shared policy:

  - **vertical** (``height > width x 1.8`` AND indicator is a
    ``VerticalBar``): stacked text column on the left, vertical bar on
    the right (or value-over-bar in very narrow cells).
  - **ring** (indicator is a ``Ring`` or ``Arc``): caption above, ring
    fills the rest, hero centred inside the ring.
  - **stacked** (``0.7 ≤ aspect ≤ 1.5`` AND ``min(w,h) ≥ 100``): three
    watchOS bands — caption row, hero row (auto-fit), supporting strip
    above the indicator. Justified ``space-evenly`` so the bands breathe.
  - **compact** (everything else — wide+short, tiny grids): an
    ``Adaptive([icon, caption, hero])`` header pinned to the top, the
    indicator pinned to the bottom.

The thresholds match ``component_helpers._pick_bar_mode`` (already
validated against the gauges samples). ``BarGauge`` / ``RingGauge`` /
``ArcGauge`` will be re-expressed as thin wrappers around ``DataCard``
in a later commit.
